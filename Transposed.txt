[Intro]
(F#m) (D) (A)(E)
(F#m) (D) (A)(E)


[Verse 1]
  (F#m)                        (D)
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
   (A)                     (E)
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
  (F#m)                     (D)
Don't know what you're expecting of me
   (A)                       (E)             (D)    (E)
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
       (F#m)              (A)               (D)      (E)
Every step I take is another mistake to you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)


[Chorus]
(F#m)            (D)                    (A)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
               (E)                  (F#)m
I've become so tired, so much more aware
             (D)                 (A)
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                (E)                 (F#)m
Is be more like me and be less like you


[Verse 2]
                              (D)
Can't you see that you're smothering me
    (A)                 (E)           (F#)m
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
                            (D)
Cause everything that you thought I would be
       (A)          (E)               (D)      (E)
Has fallen apart right in front of you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
       (F#m)                   (A)              (D)      (E)
Every step that I take is another mistake to you

(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
             (F#m)                      (A)     (E)
And every second I waste is more than I can take


[Chorus]
(F#m)            (D)                    (A)
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
               (E)                  (F#)m
I've become so tired, so much more aware
             (D)                 (A)
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                (E)                 (D)
Is be more like me and be less like you


[Bridge]
Hint: starting with the (D)the bass tones should ascend till(A)/(C#)and then go back down to(D). The ascendance
of the bass tones is crucial for the intensification of this part.

       (E)
And I know
      (F#m)D/(G#)(A)Bm7  (D)
I may end up failing too
       (E)
But I know
          (C#)                      (C#)sus4
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you


[Chorus]
